# PRODIGY_ML_TRACK_2

ðŸª¢ This is a model which was produced to Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history by using the concept of machine learing.

ðŸª¢ Under this project I have used numpy, pandas, skit-learn and also matplot in order to satsify and meet the conditions of this project.

**STEP I: Testing Data**

   ðŸª¢Under this section, I have implemnented Pandas to read the files and check for any errors in our data set and also select the varibales in which the prediction of price was going to be undertaken.
   
**STEP II: Data Visualization**

   ðŸª¢Under this section , I have implmented the use of Matplot and also Histogram map inorder to draw relationship between the Age, Annual Income and  Spending Score with the other selected variable in STAGE 1.
   
   ðŸª¢ I have excluded any type of non numerical and irrelvant data inorder to make sure there were no errors.
   
   ðŸª¢ Under the division of the Scattering map, we have used seaborn module to make a hierarchial relationship between Annula Income and Age.
   
   ðŸª¢ Also we have implmented the use of msno to see the matrix grid of the whole data set under the shade.
   
**STAGE III: K_Clustering**

 ðŸª¢ Under this , we have set 3 varibales for our Cluster modeling by  segmenting each and everyone one of them to make a sensful relationship.
 
   ðŸª¢ X=Spending Score (1-100), Age and Annual Income

**STAGE IV: Machine MOdeling**

      ðŸª¢ Implmented the clustering model by using Sk-learning under KMeans.
      ðŸª¢ We have used the Elbow Method inorder to get optimal value of clusters
